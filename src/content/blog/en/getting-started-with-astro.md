# Getting Started with Astro

Astro is a revolutionary static site generator that's changing how we think about building websites. With its unique approach of shipping zero JavaScript by default, Astro delivers incredibly fast websites while still allowing you to use your favorite UI frameworks when needed.

## What Makes Astro Special?

### Zero JavaScript by Default
Unlike other frameworks that ship JavaScript bundles regardless of whether you need them, Astro only includes JavaScript when you explicitly opt-in. This results in:

- **Faster load times**: No unnecessary JavaScript to download and parse
- **Better SEO**: Search engines can easily crawl your content
- **Improved Core Web Vitals**: Better performance metrics out of the box

### Component Islands Architecture
Astro introduces the concept of "islands" - interactive components that are hydrated independently. This means:

```astro
---
// This runs on the server
const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
---

<div>
  <h1>Static Content</h1>
  <InteractiveComponent client:load data={data} />
  <p>More static content</p>
</div>
```

Only the `InteractiveComponent` will be hydrated on the client, while the rest remains static HTML.

### Framework Agnostic
You can use React, Vue, Svelte, or any other framework within the same project:

```astro
---
import ReactComponent from './ReactComponent.jsx';
import VueComponent from './VueComponent.vue';
import SvelteComponent from './SvelteComponent.svelte';
---

<div>
  <ReactComponent client:visible />
  <VueComponent client:idle />
  <SvelteComponent client:media="(max-width: 768px)" />
</div>
```

## Getting Started

### Installation
Create a new Astro project with:

```bash
npm create astro@latest my-astro-site
cd my-astro-site
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Project Structure
A typical Astro project looks like this:

```
src/
├── components/
│   └── Header.astro
├── layouts/
│   └── Layout.astro
├── pages/
│   ├── index.astro
│   └── about.astro
└── styles/
    └── global.css
```

### Creating Your First Page
Pages in Astro are created in the `src/pages/` directory:

```astro
---
// src/pages/index.astro
const title = "Welcome to Astro";
---

<html>
  <head>
    <title>{title}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>{title}</h1>
    <p>This is my first Astro page!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Advanced Features

### Content Collections
Astro's content collections provide type-safe content management:

```typescript
// src/content/config.ts
import { defineCollection, z } from 'astro:content';

const blog = defineCollection({
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    description: z.string(),
    pubDate: z.date(),
    tags: z.array(z.string()),
  }),
});

export const collections = { blog };
```

### Built-in Optimizations
Astro includes many optimizations out of the box:

- **Image optimization**: Automatic image compression and format conversion
- **CSS bundling**: Automatic CSS minification and bundling
- **Asset optimization**: Optimized asset loading and caching

## Best Practices

1. **Use static generation when possible**: Leverage Astro's static generation for better performance
2. **Minimize client-side JavaScript**: Only hydrate components that need interactivity
3. **Optimize images**: Use Astro's built-in image optimization
4. **Leverage content collections**: Use type-safe content management for blogs and documentation

## Conclusion

Astro represents a paradigm shift in web development, prioritizing performance and developer experience. By shipping zero JavaScript by default and allowing selective hydration, it delivers the best of both worlds: the performance of static sites with the flexibility of modern frameworks.

Whether you're building a blog, documentation site, or marketing website, Astro provides the tools you need to create fast, modern web experiences.
