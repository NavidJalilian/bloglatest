I've always been curious about how new and innovative tools work under the hood. What are the technical decisions behind them? Why those choices? What problems were they solving?

So I'm kicking off a series where I dig into exactly that — analyzing how popular tools and features are built, technically. First up: **Google Sheets.**

## The First Clue: No `<input>` Elements?

When I first opened Google Sheets and inspected the DOM, something stood out right away: there were _no_ `<input>` elements on the page.

That was surprising. You'd think a spreadsheet would be full of inputs, right? But there were none. Why?

One obvious answer: **the browser can't handle that many inputs.** But then the question becomes, how many can it actually handle?

## Testing Browser Input Limits

To test this myself, I created a simple page and kept adding inputs (using React).

Most frontend resources agree: browser performance tanks quickly after rendering around 1,000 inputs.

![Performance chart showing input element limits]

You can get away with maybe 5,000 inputs before lag kicks in. But once you pass that, things get ugly. Browsers slow down, interaction becomes choppy, and any rendering that takes more than 16ms per frame drops below 60 FPS—a noticeable problem in any UI. Push further, and the browser straight-up crashes.

Here are some performance numbers you can use to scare your frontend developer friends:

### Performance Breakdown by Input Count

| Input Count | Render Time | FPS | User Experience |
|-------------|-------------|-----|-----------------|
| 1,000       | ~8ms        | 60  | Smooth          |
| 5,000       | ~15ms       | 60  | Slight lag      |
| 10,000      | ~25ms       | 40  | Noticeable lag  |
| 20,000      | ~50ms       | 20  | Choppy          |
| 50,000+     | >100ms      | <10 | Unusable        |

## So, How Does Google Sheets Handle It?

Clearly, rendering a full spreadsheet with thousands of input fields is off the table. So, how does Google Sheets pull it off?

**The answer: virtualization.**

![Virtualization concept diagram]

Virtualization means you only render the small visible portion of the UI that the user can currently see, and reuse those components as the user scrolls. Instead of rendering 1 million cells, you render maybe 100, and just make them look like they're all there.

This approach is so efficient, it feels like scrolling through butter.

No matter how big your data gets, the actual number of rendered elements stays the same. The grid is an illusion, and it works.

## A Simple Virtualized Grid in React

Here's a minimal example of how you could build a virtualized grid in React. It renders a grid of fake cells using only the ones visible in the viewport (plus a small buffer):

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

const VirtualizedGrid = ({ 
  totalRows = 1000000, 
  totalCols = 1000, 
  cellHeight = 30, 
  cellWidth = 100 
}) => {
  const [scrollTop, setScrollTop] = useState(0);
  const [scrollLeft, setScrollLeft] = useState(0);
  const [containerHeight, setContainerHeight] = useState(400);
  const [containerWidth, setContainerWidth] = useState(800);
  
  const containerRef = useRef();

  // Calculate visible range with buffer
  const buffer = 5;
  const startRow = Math.max(0, Math.floor(scrollTop / cellHeight) - buffer);
  const endRow = Math.min(totalRows, startRow + Math.ceil(containerHeight / cellHeight) + buffer * 2);
  const startCol = Math.max(0, Math.floor(scrollLeft / cellWidth) - buffer);
  const endCol = Math.min(totalCols, startCol + Math.ceil(containerWidth / cellWidth) + buffer * 2);

  const handleScroll = (e) => {
    setScrollTop(e.target.scrollTop);
    setScrollLeft(e.target.scrollLeft);
  };

  const renderCell = (row, col) => (
    <div
      key={`${row}-${col}`}
      style={{
        position: 'absolute',
        top: row * cellHeight,
        left: col * cellWidth,
        width: cellWidth,
        height: cellHeight,
        border: '1px solid #ddd',
        display: 'flex',
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
        backgroundColor: 'white'
      }}
    >
      {`${row},${col}`}
    </div>
  );

  const visibleCells = [];
  for (let row = startRow; row < endRow; row++) {
    for (let col = startCol; col < endCol; col++) {
      visibleCells.push(renderCell(row, col));
    }
  }

  return (
    <div
      ref={containerRef}
      style={{
        width: containerWidth,
        height: containerHeight,
        overflow: 'auto',
        position: 'relative'
      }}
      onScroll={handleScroll}
    >
      {/* Virtual scrollable area */}
      <div
        style={{
          width: totalCols * cellWidth,
          height: totalRows * cellHeight,
          position: 'relative'
        }}
      >
        {visibleCells}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default VirtualizedGrid;
```

### Key Concepts in Virtualization

1. **Viewport Calculation**: Only render what's visible plus a small buffer
2. **Absolute Positioning**: Position cells based on their logical coordinates
3. **Virtual Scrollable Area**: Create a large container to enable proper scrolling
4. **Dynamic Rendering**: Add/remove cells as the user scrolls

## But There's a Catch

This solves the initial problem, but it introduces new ones:

- What if the user zooms out and tries to see **10,000+ cells** at once?
- What about formulas? Re-rendering formulas across huge datasets is expensive.
- What if the device is low-end? Virtualization helps, but managing state and reactivity at scale still has a cost.

Google Sheets has to handle all that and more.

## The Canvas Connection

Interestingly, Google built Sheets around the same time they were working on Google Maps. They were already using **canvas** to render large, interactive views efficiently. That tech carried over. So when you use Sheets, you're getting the benefit of years of optimization at the rendering layer.

Canvas rendering provides:
- **Pixel-perfect control** over rendering
- **Better performance** for complex graphics
- **Custom interaction handling**
- **Efficient redraws** of only changed areas

## Performance Optimizations in Practice

Google Sheets employs several advanced techniques:

### 1. Layered Rendering
- **Grid layer**: Static grid lines
- **Content layer**: Cell values and formatting
- **Selection layer**: Highlights and borders
- **UI layer**: Menus and controls

### 2. Intelligent Caching
- Cache rendered cell content
- Reuse calculations when possible
- Lazy load non-visible data

### 3. Progressive Enhancement
- Load basic functionality first
- Add advanced features as needed
- Graceful degradation on slower devices

## What's Next?

This is just the first part of the series. Next, I'll explore **canvas-based rendering**, how it works, how to integrate it, and what it can (and can't) solve.

Eventually, we'll also look at how Google handles formulas, editing, collaboration, and more.

Stay tuned for the next deep dive into the technical marvels that power the tools we use every day.
