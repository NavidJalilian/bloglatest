so for a lonng time i been doing things at fastest way possible and that leads to finding ways that just work, they don't teach you anything 
you are unpassion, use AI to solve it or find some libary or old code to do it, bc we had limited brain power each day and product (before Ai)
didn't cared much that u can not do more work, so hence today u have reached a  place where u rarely have to think about problems, this obvously
problematic for long turn.

some were along the lines and i took a step back and thought what if instead of being nervous and trying to move let be curious about bugs
if i have the luxury of time to stay on it( maybe we have this all the time) and its not a big package , lets learn the why dosn't work instead
of a quick fix , then life becomes amazingly diffrent , a little more hard but as u go gets easier and u become stronger just like a game
i think this approuch is approch of software developer and every humain being faced with problems, provide the man with safty of thought and comfort
an honest man should spend his time learning the world.
